# Complete GraphQL Fixes - All Pages Working

## 🎯 Issue Summary
Category pages and other pages were not showing products due to GraphQL 500 errors caused by using `... on SimpleProduct` and `... on VariableProduct` fragments.

## ✅ Solution
Replaced all instances of problematic type fragments with interface-based fragments:
- `... on SimpleProduct` → `... on ProductWithPricing`
- `... on VariableProduct` → `... on InventoriedProduct` (for stock)

## 📁 Files Fixed

### 1. **app/category/[slug]/page.tsx**
- ✅ Fixed `GET_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS` query
- ✅ Updated ISR cache: 60s → 300s
- ✅ Fixed console logs (dev-only)
- ✅ Updated grid styling to match homepage

### 2. **app/categories/page.tsx**
- ✅ Updated ISR cache: 60s → 300s
- ✅ Fixed console logs (dev-only)

### 3. **app/product/[slug]/page.tsx**
- ✅ Updated ISR cache: 60s → 300s
- ✅ Fixed console logs (dev-only)

### 4. **lib/queries.ts** (Multiple Queries Fixed)
- ✅ `GET_FLASH_SALE_PRODUCTS` - Flash sale products query
- ✅ `GET_PRODUCT_BY_SLUG` - Individual product page query
- ✅ `GET_CART` - Cart contents query
- ✅ Removed `status: "publish"` where causing issues
- ✅ Removed unnecessary fields: `databaseId`, `type`

### 5. **lib/mutations.ts** (3 Mutations Fixed)
- ✅ `ADD_TO_CART` - Add to cart mutation
- ✅ `REMOVE_FROM_CART` - Remove from cart mutation
- ✅ `UPDATE_CART_QUANTITY` - Update quantity mutation

## 🔄 Query Pattern Used

### ❌ OLD (Broken):
```graphql
... on SimpleProduct {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
  stockStatus
}
... on VariableProduct {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
  stockStatus
}
```

### ✅ NEW (Working):
```graphql
... on ProductWithPricing {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
}
... on InventoriedProduct {
  stockStatus
  stockQuantity
}
```

## 🎨 Styling Consistency

All product grids now use consistent styling:

### Mobile (< 768px)
- 2 columns
- Gap: 5px horizontal, 4px vertical
- Full width (no margins)

### Desktop (≥ 1024px)
- 4-5 columns
- Gap: 16px (1rem) both directions
- Container with margins

## ⚙️ Optimizations Applied

### Cache Strategy
- All pages: 300 seconds (5 minutes) ISR
- Consistent across homepage, categories, products

### Console Logs
- All error logs wrapped in `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- Clean production logs

### Performance
- Parallel API calls on homepage
- Rate limiting on infinite scroll
- Debounced scroll handler

## 🔍 Why This Works

The issue was with WooCommerce's GraphQL type registration. The concrete types (`SimpleProduct`, `VariableProduct`) have registration conflicts, but the interfaces (`ProductWithPricing`, `InventoriedProduct`) are properly implemented and work consistently.

### Technical Explanation:
1. **Type Resolution Conflict:** WooCommerce registers multiple types with similar names, causing GraphQL to fail when trying to resolve `SimpleProduct` or `VariableProduct`.

2. **Interface Approach:** Using interfaces like `ProductWithPricing` and `InventoriedProduct` bypasses the type resolution issue because interfaces are resolved at runtime based on implementation, not type registration.

3. **Backward Compatible:** All WooCommerce products implement these interfaces, so the queries work for both simple and variable products.

## 📝 Future Maintenance

### When Adding New Queries:
Always use this pattern:
```graphql
products {
  nodes {
    id
    name
    slug
    image {
      sourceUrl
      altText
    }
    ... on ProductWithPricing {
      price
      regularPrice
      salePrice
    }
    ... on InventoriedProduct {
      stockStatus
      stockQuantity
    }
  }
}
```

### Avoid These Patterns:
```graphql
# ❌ DON'T USE
... on SimpleProduct { }
... on VariableProduct { }
where: { status: "publish" }  # Often causes issues
```

## 🎉 Result

**All pages now working!** Every product query across the entire application has been updated to use the working interface-based pattern.

- ✅ No more 500 errors
- ✅ Products display on all pages
- ✅ Consistent styling
- ✅ Optimized caching
- ✅ Clean production code
