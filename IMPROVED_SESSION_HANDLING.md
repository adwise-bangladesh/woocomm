# Improved Session Handling for Checkout

## 🔧 **New Approach - Fallback Strategy:**

### **1. Try Regular Client First:**
```javascript
try {
  // Try with regular graphqlClient first
  result = await graphqlClient.request(PLACE_ORDER, { input: checkoutInput });
  console.log('✅ Order placed with regular client');
} catch (regularError) {
  // If regular client fails, try with session handling
  console.log('⚠️ Regular client failed, trying with session...');
}
```

### **2. Fallback to Session Client:**
```javascript
// If regular client fails, try with session handling
const sessionToken = localStorage.getItem('woocommerce-session-token');
result = await fetchWithSession(PLACE_ORDER, { input: checkoutInput }, sessionToken);
```

### **3. Unified Response Handling:**
```javascript
// Handle response from either client
const orderData = result.data?.checkout?.order || result.checkout?.order;
if (orderData) {
  // Process order success
}
```

## 🚀 **Benefits:**

1. **✅ Fallback Strategy** - Tries regular client first, then session client
2. **✅ Better Error Handling** - Handles both client types gracefully
3. **✅ Session Persistence** - Saves session tokens for future use
4. **✅ Unified Response** - Handles responses from both clients

## 🧪 **Expected Flow:**

**✅ Success with Regular Client:**
```
🌐 Sending GraphQL request...
✅ Order placed with regular client
📨 GraphQL Response: {...}
✅ Order placed successfully!
```

**✅ Success with Session Client:**
```
🌐 Sending GraphQL request...
⚠️ Regular client failed, trying with session...
🔑 Session Token: Not found
📨 GraphQL Response: {...}
💾 Saved new session token
✅ Order placed successfully!
```

## 🎯 **Test Now:**
1. Clear localStorage (to test fresh session)
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Fill out form
5. Click "Place Order"
6. Watch console logs for the fallback strategy

This approach should handle both session and non-session scenarios! 🚀
