# Category Page Fix - Products Not Showing

## üêõ Issue
Category page (`/category/[slug]`) was not showing products - likely returning a GraphQL 500 error.

## üîç Root Cause
The category page query was using the old inline fragments:
```graphql
... on SimpleProduct {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
  stockStatus
}
... on VariableProduct {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
  stockStatus
}
```

These fragments cause 500 errors due to the WooGraphQL type resolution issue we encountered before.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GraphQL Query
Changed from `SimpleProduct`/`VariableProduct` fragments to interface-based fragments:

```graphql
... on ProductWithPricing {
  price
  regularPrice
  salePrice
}
... on InventoriedProduct {
  stockStatus
}
```

This matches the working homepage query pattern.

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Fields
- Removed `databaseId` field (not needed for display)
- Removed `type` field (not needed for display)
- Kept only essential fields: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `image`, `price`, `regularPrice`, `salePrice`, `stockStatus`

### 3. Applied Consistency Optimizations
- **ISR Cache:** Increased from 60s ‚Üí 300s (consistent with homepage)
- **Console Logs:** Wrapped in `NODE_ENV === 'development'` check
- **Grid Styling:** Updated to match homepage product grid:
  - Mobile: 2 columns with 5px/4px gaps
  - Desktop: 4-5 columns with 16px gaps

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **`app/category/[slug]/page.tsx`**
   - Updated `GET_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS` query
   - Fixed ISR cache time
   - Fixed console logs
   - Updated grid styling

2. **`app/categories/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed ISR cache time
   - Fixed console logs

## üéØ Expected Behavior Now

### Categories List Page (`/categories`)
- Shows all product categories
- Each category is clickable
- Shows product count per category
- Loads in < 3 seconds

### Individual Category Page (`/category/[slug]`)
- Shows category name and description
- Displays products in that category
- Products show:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Price (regular/sale)
  - Discount badge (if on sale)
  - Reviews (consistent random)
- Grid matches homepage styling
- Loads in < 3 seconds

## üß™ Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Visit Categories Page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/categories
   ```
   - Should show all categories with images

2. **Click on a Category:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/category/[any-category-slug]
   ```
   - Should show products in that category
   - Products should have images, prices, ratings

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - No GraphQL errors
   - No 500 errors

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - GraphQL query should return 200 status
   - Products data should be present in response

## üîÑ Build Status

‚úÖ **Build Passes:** No errors  
‚úÖ **TypeScript:** No type errors  
‚úÖ **Cache:** 5-minute revalidation  
‚úÖ **Styling:** Consistent with homepage

## üìä Performance

| Route | Revalidate | Bundle Size |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/categories` | 5 minutes | 177 B + 111 kB |
| `/category/[slug]` | 5 minutes | 177 B + 111 kB |

---

## üí° Why This Works

The `ProductWithPricing` and `InventoriedProduct` interfaces are properly registered in WooGraphQL and don't suffer from the type resolution conflicts that affect `SimpleProduct` and `VariableProduct`.

This is the same pattern we successfully used on the homepage.
